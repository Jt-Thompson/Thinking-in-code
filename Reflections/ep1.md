## Episode 1 – Hello 700 Batch Automation  10-13-25

**What I practiced:**  
- Writing and running .py files in VS Code  
- Using print(), newlines (\n), repetition (*)
- Reading and fixing syntax errors  

**What I saw:**  
- Terminal showed clear output lines  
- Red text (SyntaxError) pointed me to line 4 and quote mismatch  
- Adding \n created spacing; *3 repeated text automatically  

**Friction or Confusion:**  
This was my first time opening VS Code since I downloaded it about two weeks ago. At first, it was just as confusing as I expected—but that didn’t last long. Once I got into basic operations like saving files and reading formats, everything felt much more fluent compared to my initial experience.

**Connection to my 700-Batch System:**  
- Each print() = one output node or reflection line  
- Syntax error = structural bug; logic bug = reasoning error  
- The loop here is the same command → execution → feedback pattern my batch engine will use  

**Next Action:**  
Move to Episode 2 (variables = state memory).
