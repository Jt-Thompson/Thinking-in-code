# Reflection Engine — Learning Phase (Used networkchuck python course on youtube: Episodes 1–10)
This repo documents my first nine days of learning Python hands-on, while mapping
how code structure mirrors system design.  
Each episode includes the code practice, notes, and reflection that built the base
for my future learning and building with code as a meduim.

---

## 🧠 Overview
- **Focus:** Systems thinking → hands-on coding.
- **Goal:** Learn Python as a language for expressing logic, not just syntax.
- **Timeframe:** 9 days of consistent practice and reflection.

## 📚 Structure
| Folder | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| `sandbox/` | All 10 episode code files (Ep01–Ep10). Each one is a self-contained practice round. |
| `docs/reflections/` | Reflections per episode — thoughts, struggles, and lessons. |
| `docs/nine_days_in.md` | The essay closing the first arc. |

## 🧩 Highlights
- Learned core Python: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, files.
- Built my first working practice scripts.
- Mapped system design thinking into code.
- Documented every step — friction, insights, and compounding growth.
