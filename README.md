This repo documents my first nine days of learning Python hands-on, while mapping
how code structure mirrors system design.  
Each episode includes the code practice, notes, and reflection that built the base
for my future learning and building with code as a meduim.(Used networkchuck python course on youtube: Episodes 1–10)

---

## 🧠 Overview
- **Focus:** Systems thinking → hands-on coding.
- **Goal:** Learn Python as a language for expressing logic, not just syntax.
- **Timeframe:** 9 days of consistent practice and reflection.

### 📂 Contents

- `sandbox/` → 10 hands-on Python practice files (Ep01–Ep10)
- `reflections/` → Learning notes and insights per episode
- `docs/` → Final essays and full 10-episode summary

## 🧩 Highlights
- Learned core Python: variables, loops, conditionals, functions, files.
- Built my first working practice scripts.
- Mapped system design thinking into code.
- Documented every step — friction, insights, and compounding growth.
